Represent players and their match history using a directed weighted graph\n","- Let $G = (V, E)$ be the directed weighted graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices (players in our case) and $E$ is the set of directed edges with weights (matches between players).\n","  - The adjacency matrix $A$ of this graph $G$ will be populated based on the following:\n","    - $A_{i j}=2$ if player $i$ has won against player $j$\n","    - $A_{i j}=1.5$ if player $i$ drew with player $j$\n","    - $A_{i j}=1$ if player $i$ lost to player $j$\n","    - $A_{i j}=0$ if player $i$ has not played against player $j$\n","  - Let $H = (V, E')$ be the new unweighted undirected graph we want to create, where $E'$ is the set of undirected edges. $H$ represents the new match pairings for the next round.\n","  - The reason I formulated it this way is because it allows for efficient calculations and visualization.\n","2. Objective Function:\n","$$\n","\\text{Minimize} \\quad \\sum_{i < j} x_{ij} \\cdot |\\text{Score}(i) - \\text{Score}(j)|\n","$$\n","- $x_{ij}$ is 1 if there is an edge between $i$ and $j$ in $E'$, and 0 otherwise.\n","- The score of each player is the sum of the weights of the outgoing edges from the node representing that player. This can be calculated as the weighted out-degree of the node:\n","$$\n","\\operatorname{Score}(i)=\\sum_j A_{i j}\n","$$\n","\n","4. Constraints:\n","- Each node must be paired only once: $\\sum_{j} x_{ij} = 1$ for all $i \\in V$. People can't play two games at once lol!\n","- No pairs from the original graph: $x_{ij} = 0$ if $(i, j) \\in E$. We don't want people who played each other to play each other again.\n","\n","## Side Commentary\n","\n","### Formulation of a Weighted Objective Method\n","\n","1. **Define Variables:**\n","- We will inevitably want to also optimize for people having an even number of white and black. This is my idea for solving this problem. We can track the number of excess whites or blacks by adding an integer value to a node each time they get white and subtracting an integer for getting black.\n","- $T_i$: Integer value associated with node $i$.\n","- $p_{ij}$: Binary variable indicating if the pair $(i, j)$ from the original graph is allowed to play again.\n","\n","2. **Objective Function:**\n","   - Define the weighted combined objective:\n","     $$\n","     \\text{Minimize} \\quad w_1 \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{i < j} x_{ij} \\cdot |\\text{Score}(i) - \\text{Score}(j)| \\right) + w_2 \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{i} |T_i| \\right) + w_3 \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{i < j} p_{ij} \\right)\n","     $$\n","     - Here, $w_3$ is a weight that penalizes the inclusion of pairs from the original graph.\n","\n","3. **Constraints:**\n","- Each node must be paired only once: $\\sum_{j} x_{ij} = 1$ for all $i \\in V$\n","- Pairing constraint with a soft violation penalty:\n","$$\n","x_{ij} + p_{ij} \\le 1 \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in E\n","$$\n","  - This ensures that if $(i, j)$ is in the original graph, either $x_{ij} = 0$ or $p_{ij} = 1$.\n","\n","- Integer adjustment constraints for edges added:\n","$$\n","y_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\quad z_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\quad y_{ij} + z_{ij} = 1 \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\text{ with } x_{ij} = 1\n","$$\n","    - If $y_{ij} = 1$:\n","      $$\n","      T_i = T_i + 1, \\quad T_j = T_j - 1\n","      $$\n","    - If $z_{ij} = 1$:\n","      $$\n","      T_i = T_i - 1, \\quad T_j = T_j + 1\n","      $$"],"metadata":{"id":"DpsdsiYIRoc0"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NUtzcpF7K41D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716161223137,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":25964,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}},"outputId":"098469b8-313e-4df4-fc29-67de4964db9c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting pulp\n","  Downloading PuLP-2.8.0-py3-none-any.whl (17.7 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m17.7/17.7 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pulp\n","Successfully installed pulp-2.8.0\n"]}],"source":["!pip install pulp"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/My Drive/chess_pairings"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QjI5fnMjLDMx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716161244548,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":19144,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}},"outputId":"6a589500-cc2a-4093-956a-53717a5ff760"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","/content/drive/My Drive/chess_pairings\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from optimization.primary_optimization import solve_pairing_problem\n","from utils.import_data import add_edges_from_optimized_csv\n","from utils.export_data import export_node_pair_info_to_csv\n","from utils.tests import test_pairs\n","from utils.simulate_scenarios import add_weighted_edges\n","import networkx as nx\n","import numpy as np\n","import csv\n","import os"],"metadata":{"id":"ibRifGBHLT6e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716161247754,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1743,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Initialize Player Base\n","\n","The player base is initialized as an empty $(n\\times n)$ graph $G$"],"metadata":{"id":"vKfNBi3aMpYz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# List of names for the nodes\n","names = ['Alice', 'Ben', 'Charlotte', 'David', 'Emma', 'Fiona', 'Grace', 'Hannah', 'Isaac', 'Julia']\n","\n","# Create a graph\n","adjacency_matrix = np.zeros((len(names),len(names)))\n","G = nx.from_numpy_array(adjacency_matrix,create_using=nx.DiGraph)\n","\n","# Add labels as node attributes\n","for i, name in enumerate(names):\n","    G.nodes[i]['label'] = name"],"metadata":{"id":"CpR7ezDULsox","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716163979749,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":156,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Integer Linear Programming\n","\n","Linear programming (LP) is a method for optimizing a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.

It is typically written as:\n","   $$\n","   \\text{maximize (or minimize)} \\; c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \\cdots + c_n x_n\n","   $$\n","   where $c_i$ are the coefficients, and $x_i$ are the decision variables.\n","\n","2. **Decision Variables**: Variables that are adjusted to optimize the objective function. In your case, these variables are integers that can only be 0 or 1, making it an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, specifically a Binary Linear Programming problem.\n","\n","3. **Constraints**: Linear equations or inequalities that restrict the values the decision variables can take. They can be written in the form:\n","   $$\n","   a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \\cdots + a_{1n} x_n \\le b_1\n","   $$\n","   $$\n","   a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \\cdots + a_{2n} x_n = b_2\n","   $$\n","   and so on.\n","\n","4. **Non-negativity Restriction**: The decision variables are often required to be non-negative, but in the case of binary variables, this is naturally satisfied since they are either 0 or 1.\n","\n","### Solving a Binary Linear Programming Problem\n","\n","Binary Linear Programming (BLP) problems are a special case of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problems where decision variables are restricted to be binary (0 or 1). The general approach to solving BLPs is as follows:\n","\n","1. **Formulate the Problem**: Define the objective function, decision variables, and constraints.\n","\n","2. **Relaxation**: Solve the relaxed LP problem by allowing the decision variables to take any values between 0 and 1 (rather than strictly 0 or 1). This is typically done using the simplex method or interior-point methods.\n","\n","3. **Branch and Bound**: If the relaxed solution does not satisfy the integer constraints, use the branch and bound method:\n","   - **Branching**: Divide the problem into subproblems by fixing some variables to 0 or 1.\n","   - **Bounding**: Solve the relaxed version of each subproblem. If the solution to a subproblem is infeasible or worse than the current best solution, discard it.\n","   - **Pruning**: Continue branching and bounding until all subproblems are solved or discarded.\n","\n","### Example\n","\n","Consider a simple binary linear programming problem:\n","\n","**Objective Function**:\n","$$\n","\\text{maximize} \\; 3x_1 + 2x_2\n","$$\n","\n","**Constraints**:\n","$$\n","x_1 + x_2 \\le 1\n","$$\n","$$\n","x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}\n","$$\n","\n","**Solution Steps**:\n","1. **Relaxation**: Solve the LP relaxation by allowing $x_1, x_2 \\in [0, 1]$:\n","   - Objective: maximize $3x_1 + 2x_2$\n","   - Constraint: $x_1 + x_2 \\le 1$\n","   - Solution to relaxation: $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 0$\n","\n","2. **Branch and Bound**: Check if the relaxed solution is valid for the binary constraints:\n","   - The solution $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 0$ is valid since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both binary.\n","   - No further branching is needed as the solution satisfies all constraints.\n","\n","Thus, the optimal solution is $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 0$ with an objective function value of 3.\n","\n","In more complex problems, the branch and bound method would involve multiple iterations of branching and bounding until the optimal integer solution is found.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VmSQaBBVNFt5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pairs = solve_pairing_problem(G)"],"metadata":{"id":"evu6fQexLyoS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716164058905,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":149,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_pairs(G, pairs)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EpNU8iUrL2-O","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716164060115,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":135,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}},"outputId":"3a06631d-8fd7-4bec-efe4-c9bf5f4e23ba"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["All tests passed!\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["add_weighted_edges(G, pairs)\n","\n","'''\n","Alternatively, you can use the following function to manually put in the results\n","\n","add_edges_from_optimized_csv(G, filename)\n","\n","where filename is in the format output of export_node_pair_info_to_csv(G, pairs, filename)\n","'''"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"id":"AIFK1J55MDa2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716164061363,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":137,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}},"outputId":"9ea560e5-2db2-46a3-9df7-9ff50ca8fe37"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'\\nAlternatively, you can use the following function to manually put in the results\\n\\nadd_edges_from_optimized_csv(G, filename)\\n\\nwhere filename is in the format output of export_node_pair_info_to_csv(G, pairs, filename)\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["filename = 'data/node_pair_info00.csv'\n","\n","export_node_pair_info_to_csv(G, pairs, filename)"],"metadata":{"id":"X-0AZVqUMKst","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716164066371,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":153,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Simulate Multiple Rounds"],"metadata":{"id":"TDNYai93ONDt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# List of names for the nodes\n","names = ['Alice', 'Ben', 'Charlotte', 'David', 'Emma', 'Fiona', 'Grace', 'Hannah', 'Isaac', 'Julia']\n","\n","# Create a graph\n","adjacency_matrix = np.zeros((len(names),len(names)))\n","G = nx.from_numpy_array(adjacency_matrix,create_using=nx.DiGraph)\n","\n","# Add labels as node attributes\n","for i, name in enumerate(names):\n","    G.nodes[i]['label'] = name\n","\n","\n","for i in range(9):\n","\n","    pairs = solve_pairing_problem(G)\n","\n","    test_pairs(G, pairs)\n","\n","    add_weighted_edges(G, pairs)\n","\n","    filename = 'data/node_pair_info_sim'+str(i)+'.csv'\n","\n","    export_node_pair_info_to_csv(G, pairs, filename)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0fpKKKHUOSfy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716164085212,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":404,"user":{"displayName":"James Raj","userId":"05533719088400897699"}},"outputId":"aa34e24c-02e5-45d1-c74e-2a96bcc73d04"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n","All tests passed!\n"]}]}]}
